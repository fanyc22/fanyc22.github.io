With the surge in data computation, Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) becomes crucial to offering low-latency and high-throughput communication for data centers, but it faces new security threats.
This paper presents Ragnar, a comprehensive suite of hardware-contention-based volatile-channel attacks leveraging the under-explored security vulnerabilities in RDMA hardware.
Through comprehensive microbenchmark reverse engineering, we analyze RDMA NICs at multiple granularity levels and then construct covert-channel attacks, achieving 3.2x the bandwidth of state-of-the-art RDMA-targeted attacks on CX-5.
We apply side-channel attacks on real-world distributed databases and disaggregated memory, where we successfully fingerprint operations and recover sensitive address data with 95.6% accuracy.
